# Python and R Analysis

Hi, welcome to my Data Science Repository. 

This repository consists of numerous projects which I have completed during the duration of my time studying at the Tech Academy. Additionally, this repository contains some of the projects I am currently working on to further practice.

The languages utilized in this repository are either Python or R, and include visualizations, machine learning models, and interactive dashboards. 

I hope you enjoy viewing my work!
