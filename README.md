# Python and R Analysis

Hi, welcome to my Data Science Repository. 

This repository consists of numerous projects which I have completed during the duration of my time studying at the Tech Academy. Additionally, this repository contains some of the projects I am currently working on to further practice.

The languages utilized in this repository are either Python or R, and include visualizations, machine learning models, and interactive dashboards. 

The dashboards folder consists of projects created utilizing R and the Shiny package in order to create these dashboards. The R_Shiny_Final1 file is an interactive dashboard of the Iris flowers dataset. This dashboard includes a tree model for predicting the type of flower based upon two factors assigned by user input. Additionally, the dashboard includes multiple static visualizations in order for the user to have a better understanding of each type of flower.

The projects folder consists of projects created utilizing Python in Jupyter Notebook. This folder consists of numerous files which contain an exploratory analysis of the data, visualizations, and in some cases findings. The R_Machine_Learning2 file consists of creating a random forest model which attempted to find the most accurate hyperparameters in creating a model for predicting prices of homes. This also includes other ML models to test for accuracy, but the random forest models which were created at the end were by far the most accurate in the analysis. There is another file named Twitter Sentiment Analysis which utilized numerous text mining packages such as nltk, text blob, and sklearn. Additionaly, this folder consists of numerous data cleaning and analysis methods in order to perform a statisical analysis such as chi squared, and linear regression.

I hope you enjoy viewing my work!
